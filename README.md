# LaundryMate ðŸ§ºâœ¨

**LaundryMate** is a mobile app developed as a **Bachelor's thesis project** to address the common problem of improper laundry care due to users' unfamiliarity with textile care symbols, which can lead to damaged garments, wasted resources, and appliance wear. The app uses an automated visual recognition system (YOLOv8n) to detect care symbols, applies deterministic rules to group garments and recommend optimal washing programs, saves a personal laundry history in the cloud, and provides daily maintenance tips via a language model, all through a smooth, cross-platform interface built with React Native and Django, demonstrating the practical integration of modern AI techniques into a real-world mobile application.
